Wishlist of things to implement (unordered)

- [ ] *** Pipeline: do a check to see how many NAN values get passed from stage to stage...im guessing the binning helps us solve that, but does adaptive filtering actually solve it first?
- [ ] *** In the diagnostics section, have a button that produces a *HISTORGRAM* of the lengths of actions distributions (1 histogram per action...? Seems that way for now...)
- [ ] Killian: rename internal vars for Pipelines from _, scaled to unscaled, _
- [ ] Multiple features select on the Streamlit app model building section
- [ ] Test: ensure new/variable features selected
- [x] Add colour to video assignment
- [x] Add binning feature slider
- [x] Add FPS input into params
- [x] Add colour to text in example behaviour videos
- [ ] GMM plot should modify labels to match behaviours instead of just assignment number (WHEN POSSIBLE)
- [ ] Aaron: Confusion matrix for diagnostics (Aaron)
- [ ] Aaron: Add PCA plotting for training data for BasePipeline
